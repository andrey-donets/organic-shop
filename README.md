# organic-shop
This project demonstrates a simple e-commerce application for an imaginary organic shop. It is built with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap 4 as the final project in my complete Angular course:  http://programmingwithmosh.com/courses/complete-angular-master-class/  In this course, you'll see how I've built this application, step-by-step.  By the end of watching course, you'll be able to:  Use Angular and Firebase to build real-time serverless applications Think like a software engineer Write clean and testable code Refactor bad code into good code Design classes and modules with proper boundaries
